# Assembler-for-Stack-Based-Architecture
This project implements an assembler for a stack-based machine architecture, providing a graphical interface to load and execute assembly instructions. The assembler supports a range of operations such as pushing values onto the stack, performing arithmetic operations, and managing control flow with jump instructions.
